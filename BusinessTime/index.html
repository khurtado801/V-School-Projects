                                        I've solidified myself in the pantheon of sample based music as a trailblazing DJ, Producer, tastemaker and bona fide House Music icon. After 3 decades criss-crossing the globe, I'm showing no signs of slowing down and will remain innovative, humble,
                                        and firmly rooted in the underground. “I look at my job as a ‘modern day traveling minstrel’. To bring new music to as many places as I can and expose obscure records that otherwise might go hidden.”.</p>

                                        Early analog synthesizers used technology from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally "modular" synthesizers, consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that
                                        resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and voltage-controlled
                                        amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators. Some synthesizers
                                        also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as
                                        a sound-generating and sound-processing system.</p>

                            <p>For as long as Ken can remember two things always seemed to capture his attention; figuring out how things worked and music. His tinkering with the inner working of machines started with a simple cash register that was purchased
                                from the Deseret Industries. Hours upon hours would be spent stripping down any device that he could get his hands on to its core. It wasn't about "fixing", Ken was just fascinated with their inner workings. This fascination
                                about how things work would also prove to be a bridge to his love for music. Music to Ken is more than something to be listened to, Ken needed to view its inner workings as well.</p>
